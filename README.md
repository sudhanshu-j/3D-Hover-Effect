# 3D-Hover-Effect

This project showcases a 3D hover effect on images using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an interactive experience where users can hover over images to see dynamic 3D transformations and click on an image to fully view it. This project combines modern CSS properties with JavaScript for a visually engaging gallery.

## Features

- **3D Hover Interaction**: Images respond to mouse movements, tilting in 3D with depth effects using translateZ     and rotateY.

- **Click to View**: Users can click on any image to view it in full scale, making it more interactive and user-     friendly.

- **Filter Effects**: Images are styled with CSS filter properties like grayscale and brightness to create a         visually appealing hover state.

- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transitions ensure smooth and fluid animations during hover and click actions.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the image gallery and the layout of the webpage.

- **CSS3**: For styling, 3D transforms, and filter effects.
    
    - transform: translateZ(), rotateY() for 3D movement.
    
    - filter: grayscale(), brightness() for image effects.

- **JavaScript**: To handle image click interactions and enhance user experience.

## How It Works

- **Hover Interaction**:

    - When the user hovers over an image, the transform properties apply 3D effects, rotating and shifting the         image to simulate depth and movement.
      
    -  CSS filters like grayscale and brightness are applied to enhance the visual aesthetics on hover.

- **Click to View**:

    - Clicking on an image zooms in to display it fully, allowing the user to view it in greater detail.
    
    - JavaScript is used to detect clicks and apply transformations that enlarge the image.

## Getting Started

- To view this project locally:

    - **Clone the repository**: - 
         git clone https://github.com/your-username/3D-Hover-Effect-Images.git

    - **Navigate to the project folder**: - 
         cd 3D-Hover-Effect-Images
    
    - **Open the index.html file in your browser**: - 
          open index.html

## Customization

  - **CSS Transformations**: The degree of 3D tilt and zoom can be modified in the style.css file by adjusting         the translateZ and rotateY values.
  
  - **Filter Properties**: The intensity of the grayscale and brightness effects can be tweaked for different          hover aesthetics.
  
  - **JavaScript Click Effects**: The image click functionality can be enhanced or modified in script.js to fit        your design needs.
